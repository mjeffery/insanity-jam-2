Max: Well... I think that just about finishes it.

Sue: Are you sure about this?

     Arbitration by Robo-battle heavily favors the
     Big Corporations.	

Max: What else can we do?

     If we give up, InvestCo will turn the steelmill
     into luxury housing.

Sue: I know, but were our jobs really worth the cost 
     of this machine?

Door: *knock knock knock*

      *creaks open*

Rep: Oh ho! What's this?

     Foreman, you really did build a robot!

Max: The Local 1330 doesn't back down from a fight!

Rep: You may change your tune once you're out on the
     battlefield.

     The "Progress" is InvestCo's latest military
     prototype.

     I'd hate to see your little art project 
     destroyed.

Sue: I bet you'd hate to see your fancy prototype
     destroyed too.

     We won't just roll over and spare it.

Rep: Fine then.  We'll settle this at noon tomorrow?

Sue: Count on it.
